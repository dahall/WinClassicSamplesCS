Authentication and authorization DACL editor sample
===================================================

Demonstrates the use of the ACL-Editor-related interfaces focusing on DACLs and effective access.

The Windows-classic-samples repo contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows and/or Windows Server. This repo provides a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for each sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata needed to compile and run the sample. For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, check out the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com). This sample is provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows and Windows Server.

This sample was created for Windows 8.1 and/or Windows Server 2012 R2 using Visual Studio 2013, but in many cases it will run unaltered using later versions.

Operating system requirements
-----------------------------

Client

Windows 8.1

Server

Windows Server 2012 R2

Build the sample
----------------

To build this sample, open the CustomResourceManager.sln solution file in Visual Studio 2013 for Windows 8.1 (any SKU) or later versions of Visual Studio and Windows. Press F7 (or F6 for Visual Studio 2013) or go to Build-\>Build Solution from the top menu after the sample has loaded.

Run the sample
--------------

To run this sample after building it, press F5 (run with debugging enabled) or Ctrl-F5 (run without debugging enabled) from Visual Studio for Windows 8.1 (any SKU), or select the corresponding options from the Debug menu. You are presented with a list of options corresponding to the custom resources that this sample provides (which models an online forum): there is a single FORUMS object ("Contoso Forums"), multiple SECTIONS beneath that (for example, "Hobbies"), and multiple TOPICS beneath the SECTIONS (for example, "Snowboarding"). Choose a number 1-10 to edit the security of one of these resources, and use the Effective Access tab to verify whether certain users have access.
