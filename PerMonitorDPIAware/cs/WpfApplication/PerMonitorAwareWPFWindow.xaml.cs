namespace PerMonitorAwareWPFApplication;

// This sample showcases how to make a WPF application Per-Monitor Aware. WPF uses the system DPI to scale the size of the window and 
// rendering. In order to make a WPF application Per_Monitor aware, we need to
//    a. Mark the WPF application as DPI_Unaware: In the AssemblyInfo.cs file add the following line -> [assembly:  DisableDpiAwareness] 
//    b. Inherit the main WPF window class from PerMonitorDPIWindow class. This will mark the application as Per_Monitor_DPI_Aware.  
//
// These steps will 
//    a. Make the application as Per_Monitor_DPI_Aware to the OS. This will ensure that the OS 
//        i. Does not  scale the application when the system DPI != monitor DPI
//        ii. Send the WM_DPICHANGED message whenever the DPI of the window changes
//
//    b. When the application is marked as Per_Monitor_DPI_Aware, WPF still treats the application as System DPI aware and scales the 
//       application window and rendering by the System DPI. In order to ensure that the scale of the Window and the rendering is based 
//       on the current DPI of the monitor the window is on, we need to 
//        i. Update the size of the window based on the DPI of the monitor rather than the WPF DPI
//        ii. Update the scaling used by WPF to be based on the  DPI of the monitor rather than the its own DPI 
//
// The samples includes the following core set of files/classes
//     a. PerMonitorDPIHelpers.h/PerMonitorDPIHelpers.cpp : Provides helper functions for DPI related operations
//     b. PerMonitorDPIWindow.h/PerMonitorDPIWindow.cpp: Base class that implements the operations required to make this application 
//        Per_Monitor_DPI_Aware. Implements the window message handle that is used to respond to DPI change 
//        as well as apply the appropriate scale transform to the root node of the main WPF window
//     c.  PerMonitorAwareWPFWindow.xaml/PerMonitorAwareWPFWindow.xaml.cs : Sample WPF application that uses the native helpers to showcase a per-monitor DPI aware WPF application. 
//        The Window is designed for 96 DPI with the expectation that the sample will scale the window size and the rendering scale based 
//        on the current DPI of the application.
